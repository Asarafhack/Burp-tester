# Web Testing Framework Tool

**Web Testing Framework Tool** is designed to identify vulnerabilities in web applications through automated testing. It provides comprehensive analysis to enhance web security by detecting potential threats and weaknesses.

## Features

- **Automated Scanning**: Automatically scans web applications for common vulnerabilities.
- **Customizable Tests**: Define and configure custom test cases and scanning parameters.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate detailed vulnerability reports with recommendations for remediation.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with CI/CD pipelines for continuous security testing.

## Project Structure

- `scanner.py`: Main script for performing vulnerability scans.
- `config.json`: Configuration file for setting up scan parameters.
- `reports/`: Directory for storing generated reports.
- `examples/`: Example web applications for testing.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Required Python Packages**: List of Python packages needed for this project.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

In your terminal or command prompt, execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-testing-framework-tool.git
cd web-testing-framework-tool
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

Install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. **Edit Configuration File**: Modify `config.json` to set up scan parameters and target URLs.

   Example `config.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "targets": [
       "http://example.com"
     ],
     "scan_types": [
       "sql_injection",
       "xss"
     ],
     "output_directory": "reports/"
   }
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Run a Scan

To start a vulnerability scan, execute:

```bash
python scanner.py --config config.json
```

This command will read the configuration from `config.json` and perform the scan on the specified targets.

### 2. View Reports

After the scan is complete, view the generated reports in the `reports/` directory. Reports include details on identified vulnerabilities and suggested fixes.

### Example Output

- **Vulnerability Report**: Contains details on detected vulnerabilities, including severity, affected URLs, and recommendations.

  Example report snippet:

  ```plaintext
  Vulnerability: SQL Injection
  URL: http://example.com/login
  Description: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
  Recommendation: Use parameterized queries and input validation to mitigate this issue.
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependencies Issues**: Ensure all required Python packages are installed and up-to-date.
- **Configuration Errors**: Verify that the `config.json` file is correctly formatted and contains valid URLs.
- **Scan Failures**: Check the logs for any error messages and refer to the documentation for potential solutions.

## Notes

- **Security**: Ensure you have permission to scan the target web applications to avoid legal issues.
- **Performance**: Scanning large applications or multiple targets may take some time.
